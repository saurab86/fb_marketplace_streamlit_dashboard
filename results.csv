The cooler does have a LCD screen  that you can change to whatever you want. The NZXT CAM software is amazing to use and can control all the fans and the screen from the app. The RAM uses corsairs ICUE app to control the color or you can use another app like SignalRGB. I also keep track of all the serial numbers for you in the event that something does break down the line it's going to be alot easier to replace and get another part in without doing it all yourself. The price is a break even price for me and is not negotiable. I do hold myself and my business to the highest standard.""","""$2,150""","","The All NZXT Gaming/Streaming PC"

This 2011 model has 125,900 miles and is equipped with the 6 speed MANUAL transmission. I am the third owner, I have owned for 5 years, since it had 113,000 miles. Obviously I have not put many miles on it, it was a second, """"fun"""" car for me but I have maintained it regularly with high quality parts. I will gladly cover my knowledge of its maintenance and service history with any prospective buyers.\n\nI have lightly modified the car since my ownership, including: Alta Performance intake kit, an NM Engineering Power Module, a Scan Gauge OBDII reader, stiffer wastegate spring, and an ECS Tuning rear sway bar assembly. The car has been fitted with OEM JCW (John Cooper Works) wheels fitted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. These tires are sticky, summer grade tires so I would recommend removing and refitting the car with the original wheels and tires, which I have and will attach a picture in the listing. Those wheels have Continental all seasons installed that have lots of tread depth and are in great condition, but should consider being replaced due to age - I believe the date code is 2018. I may do this myself before the car sells but both sets of wheels and tires are included in the asking price.\n\nDefects include minor exterior blemishes - a few dents, minor chips and scratches, bubbling chrome around left headlight. Interior has minor staining on headliner all the way near the hatch, can barely notice but it is there. The parking brake light is stuck on - the brake is fully disengaged but the sensor must be sticking, really a non-issue. Other than these small defects the car is in really good shape and has been a blast for me. Only selling to downsize, wish I had the space to keep it. \n\nCash only, no trades. Open to a reasonable cash offer. Located in Roselle, can meet pretty much any day.""","""$6,250""","null","2011 MINI cooper s"

I‚Äôve been building and repairing computers since I was 15, and what started as a passion has grown into a business I‚Äôm proud of today. I‚Äôm now partnered with Dell and Lenovo for repair services, but my true love lies in creating high-performance, custom PCs for enthusiasts and gamers alike. This is my second build with the HYTE Y60 and I was really picky with choosing parts to really make it stand out. \n\nKey Components:\n\nCPU - i7-12700k\nGPU -  ASUS TUF 4070 TI Super White\nMOBO - NZXT N7 Z790 White\nSSD 1 - Samsung 990 Pro 2 TB\nSSD 2 - Samsung 990 Evo 1 TB\nRam - Corsair Vengeance DDR5 32GB 6000Mhz\nPSU - NZXT C850 White\nFans 1 - NZXT 120 RGB DUO White x3\nFans 2 - NZXT F120 RGB White x5\nCooler - NZXT Kraken Elite White\nCase - HYTE Y60 White\n\nI also use NZXT CAM software to let you control all your fans, lighting, and even the LCD screen on the cooler, making it easy to personalize your system. For the RAM, Corsair‚Äôs iCUE app lets you customize the colors, and for even more flexibility you can use third-party apps like SignalRGB.\n\nI‚Äôm truly proud of how this build turned out, and I‚Äôm excited for you to see it in action. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to customize your own build with Cruisey‚Äôs Computers!\n\nWatch the video of me building this computer! \n\nThe New Cleaner HYTE Y60 Build!\nhttps://youtu.be/CoGcAfw6f4Y""","""$2,650""","","HYTE Y60 Brand New Gaming/Streaming PC"

This car was on the road throughout the 1990‚Äôs and then put into storage in 2000 for 15 years.  It has been subsequently subjected to an on-again, off-again refurbishment effort. This car was crafted in the spirit of a Tennessee moonshine runner with a nod to Mad Max, at a time when any such project was a ‚Äúshade tree‚Äù DIY effort.  Bring your bubblegum & bailing wire! It currently has a 1961 Buick 215ci engine, with all the period correct goodies:  Offenhauser dual plane manifold, Trans Dapt H25 bell housing, Carter 500cfm carb, MG V8 Conversion Co (UK) tube headers & motor mounts, BW T-50 trans, and custom dual exhaust.  Numerous custom touches to overcome routine challenges. Engine had a $4k rebuild a few miles ago.  All new brake hydraulic and friction components.  Rust free body, no physical damage.  Comes with many extra parts to include 2 complete Buick 215ci engines, a Holley 390 cfm carb, and more. Due to age and other lifestyle changes, I have lost interest in completing and possessing this project.  It needs wiring work, paint detailing, new top, new gauges, new tires, possible trans work, and a thorough shakedown and vetting of all systems before being put on the highway.  This should not be regarded as a ‚Äúrestored‚Äù car. This car is being sold ‚Äúas is‚Äù and should be regarded as a ‚Äúproject car‚Äù with nothing taken for granted until proven out by testing.

Case fans are static rainbow color. Great build for high refresh 1080p gaming on ultra settings for any game. Can handle 1440p at 60fps on most modern titles as well. Any esports title you should see around 100+ fps on highest settings. (Warzone closer to 100, games like FN seeing closer to 165)\nThis PC also has an excellent upgrade path. Lga 1200 motherboard socket means you can upgrade to any 10th or 11th gen intel processor down the road. GPU is still an amazing mid level gaming card and will carry you well through the gpu shortage until you feel it's time to upgrade. 2 more available ram slots as well which could easily be populated to get to a whopping 32gb. If you need more storage the case has ample room to bolt a hdd on the bottom next to the psu, and has 2 standard sata ssd mounting positions on the inside wall next to the motherboard.\nOnboard wifi is a huge plus. This case is relatively small as well making this a very viable LAN PC. Could easily add aftermarket handles to the top of the case.\nThis thing looks stunning as well. The pictures look good but in person it's a treat for the eyes.\n\nAsking 700, but price is negotiable.\nNo trades.\n\nFeel free to reach out with any questions. \n\nThanks for looking!
